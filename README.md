## Warning

Investing in cryptocurrency isn't suited for individuals who's afraid of risk. Expect huge fluctuations throughout the day, and 50% drop in value is more common than you think.

In 2017, I'd purchased some bitcoins `(btc)` when it was 9k and ethereum `(eth)` at $300 back in 2017. Things were looking great. Btc went has high as 20k before it went crashing down to 4~5k. 

Lots of people started panic selling at a loss. They're probably kicking themselves after seeing btc rise to 55k in 2021. 

The key is to hold onto cryptocurrencies that have potential. And to be honest, 99% of the currencies that's listed in https://coinmarketcap.com/ are crap.

So if you can't handle the heat, I suggest you invest into some index and ETFs such as S&P 500 and NASDAQ.

## Exchanges

### Binance
The biggest cryptocurrency exchange in the world. Use this to hold your cryptocurrencies, but do not buy from them. They charge a lot of fees.

### Coinbase
The biggest cryptocurrency exchange in North America, and they're insured. Do not buy from them because they also charge a chunk of fees (4% on a buy, 1~4% on a sell). I use it to sell my cryptocurrencies into $CAD.

### Netcoins
A small exchange started by a few individuals in Vancouver. 0.5% fees on purchase, and transfer fees vary from 2 cents to $5. Buy cryptocurrencies from here

### Wealthsimple
By far the crappiest exchange for cryptos. They only support btc and eth, charge a heck tons of fees, and you buy and sell on a spread (e.g. they sell you 1~3% above market, and buy 1~3% below market from you). You don't even get your own wallet, and can only buy and sell on wealthsimple exchange (can't transfer). No reason to ever use them.

## The flow

1. Buy USDT or XRP in netcoins.
2. Transfer them to your binance account.
3. Convert XRP or USDT to USDC or BUSD (USDT is not a safe currency to store money in)
4. Use USDC or BUSD to buy the cryptocurrency you want.

I usually buy $1000CAD-worth of coins on netcoins. By the time I get them to binance in USDC or BUSD, I'm usually left with $980 ~ 985 (-1.5~2%).
