## Warning

Investing in cryptocurrency isn't suited for individuals who's afraid of risk. Expect huge fluctuations throughout the day, and 50% drop in value is more common than you think.

In 2017, I'd purchased some bitcoins `(btc)` when it was at 9k and ethereum `(eth)` at $300 back in 2017. Things were looking great. Btc went as high as 20k before it went crashing down to 4~5k. 

Lots of people started panic selling at a loss. They're probably kicking themselves after seeing btc rise to 55k in 2021. 

The key is to hold onto cryptocurrencies that have potential. And to be honest, 99% of the currencies that are listed in https://coinmarketcap.com/ are crap.

So if you can't handle the heat, I suggest you invest into some index and ETFs such as S&P 500 and NASDAQ.

Cryptocurrencies perform well when foreign governments do not intervene. There were many governments that had banned cryptocurrency exchanges starting in the beginning of 2018, which caused the crypto market to drop hard.

## Exchanges

### Binance
The biggest cryptocurrency exchange in the world. Use this to hold your cryptocurrencies, but do not buy from them. They charge a lot of fees.

### Coinbase
The biggest cryptocurrency exchange in North America, and they're insured. Do not buy from them because they also charge a chunk of fees (4% on a buy, 1~4% on a sell). I use it to sell my cryptocurrencies into $CAD.

### Netcoins
A small exchange started by a few individuals in Vancouver. 0.5% fees on purchase, and transfer fees vary from 2 cents to $5. Buy cryptocurrencies from here

### Wealthsimple
By far the crappiest exchange for cryptos. They only support btc and eth, charge a heck tons of fees, and you buy and sell on a spread (e.g. they sell you at 1 ~ 3% above market, and buy from you at 1 ~ 3% below market). You don't even get your own wallet, and can only buy and sell on wealthsimple exchange (can't transfer). No reason to ever use them.

## The flow

1. Buy XRP in netcoins. Netcoins take a 0.5% commission off from your purchase, which is really cheap compared to the 5% and 2.5% that coinbase and robinhood charge you.
2. Transfer them to your binance account. Costs 0.02XRP which is only like 2cents. 
3. Convert XRP to USDC or BUSD
4. Use USDC or BUSD to buy the cryptocurrency you want.
